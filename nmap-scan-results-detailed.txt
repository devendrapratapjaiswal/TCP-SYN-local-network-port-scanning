Security Risks

1. Telnet (port 23) - HIGH RISK

    No encryption (username/password in plaintext)
    Very common legacy service; replaced by SSH
    Present on 35+ hosts â€” a massive exposure

2. SMB/NetBIOS (ports 135, 139, 445) - HIGH RISK

    Legacy Windows services
    Vulnerable to attacks like EternalBlue (WannaCry)

3. SQL Server (port 1433) - HIGH RISK

    Publicly exposed DB service
    Can be targeted for brute-force and SQL injection

4. VNC (ports 5800/5900) - HIGH RISK

    Exposes GUI desktops
    Weak/no auth can allow full device access

5. HTTP (port 80) - MEDIUM RISK

    Unencrypted communication
    Can be intercepted on local/WiFi networks

Suggestions for Remediation

| Action Item                                 | Recommended Fix                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Replace Telnet with SSH                     | Disable port 23 entirely         |
| Use firewalls to restrict internal services | Limit SMB, SQL, VNC access       |
| Update and patch all services               | Close known CVEs                 |
| Enforce strong credentials on all systems   | Brute-force resistance           |
| Monitor unusual activity via SIEM           | Detect lateral movement or scans |
